        <p><h2><span class="explain">CODE EXPLANATION</span></h2><br>Line 1: Enables you to use the input window.<br>
            Line 2: Declares your class, 
            note: make sure your classname matches your file name letter for letter, case for case and word for word to avoid error.
       it is a good practice to always start your class name with a capital letter.<br>Line 3: Is called the main method.
       <br>Line 4: Enables you use the input window.<br>Line 5: Creation of a 2dimensional array space to store eggs
        production data for 7days per week for 4weeks which is equivalent to 1month.<br>
       Line 6: This is a comment, comments are always not executed by the program.
        It's use is to give information or serve as a reminder  to the programmer.<br>
       Line 7: This is a for loop created to automatically access the rows of the array.<br>
       Line 8: This is a for loop created to automatically access the columns of the array.<br>
       Line 9/10: This code is useful in the print statement at line 11 to promt the user to enter a value, it is used to define 
       what value a user is to input, line 9/10 works with the help of the for loops at line 8/7<br>
       Line 11: Prints a statement to notify users of what they are about to input, the values of the day and week changes as 
       the user enters their input thanks to line 7,8,9 and 10. This line 11 helps notify users of what data is needed.<br>
       Line 12: creates an input window for users to input their data.<br>
    Line 13: closes the first for loop.<br>
Line 14: closes the second for loop.<br>
Line 15: prints an empty line or skips a line.<br>
Line 16: A print statement to notify a user of what data is about to be outputted<br>
Line 17: Outputs the data specified in line 16.<br>
Line 18: Is a comment to guide the user.<br>
Line 19/20: closes the main method and the class respectively!.<br>
